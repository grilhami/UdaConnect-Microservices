On my deployment of gRPC in Docker Desktop K8s the host is localhost:30003 - so depending how you deploy this project this might change for you.

To send a sample payload to the location gRPC service, you can run the "writer.py" file in the "module" folder.

To check if the payload is stored in the database, you can run the "getter.py" file in the "module" folder.

This is only for testing, since gRPC is intended to interact with the client in the mobile app.
